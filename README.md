This repository contains code examples for learning form validation using Formic and Yup. Formic is a React form library that makes it easy to create and validate forms. Yup is a schema validation library that can be used to validate form data.

The code examples in this repository cover a variety of form validation topics, including:

- Validating form input types
- Validating form field values
- Validating form field ranges
- Validating form field uniqueness
- Validating form field requiredness
- Validating form field format
- Validating form field concurrency

The code examples are well-commented and easy to follow. They are also fully tested, so you can be confident that they will work correctly.

If you are interested in learning more about form validation, I encourage you to check out this repository.
